# Simple Java Chat App

This is a simple Java chat application, built using AWT, Swing, and Socket programming. The application consists of two classes: Client and Server, allowing users to chat locally on the same system. This project was created as a team effort for a college assignment. The team members made contributions to implement various functionalities. 


## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture**: The application follows a client-server architecture where one instance acts as the server and another as the client.

- **AWT and Swing UI**: AWT and Swing libraries are used to create a user-friendly graphical interface for the chat application.

- **Socket Programming**: Socket programming is utilized for establishing communication between the client and server, enabling real-time messaging.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## Usage

1\. **Compile the Code**: Compile the Java source files for both the client and server classes.

```bash

javac Client.java

javac Server.java

```

2\. **Run the Server**: Start the server by executing the `Client` class.

```bash

java Client

```

3\. **Run the Client**: Start the client by executing the `Server` class on a different terminal instance.

```bash

java Server

```

4\. **Chatting**: Once both the server and client are running, you can start chatting between the two instances.
